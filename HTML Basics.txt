The HTML Document Object Model
(DOM)---
 

The DOM is essentially the
blueprint of the web page and is represented as a tree of “Objects.”
HTML is case insensitive.

Semantic Elements
Let’s start with semantic elements. A semantic element clearly describes its
meaning to both the browser and the developer. Some examples of
semantic elements include: <form>, <table>, and <article>.

Non-semantic Elements
Examples of non-semantic elements include: <div> and <span>
Unlike semantic elements, non-semantic elements don’t give us any hints as
to what type of content is within them. A <div> tag, for example, can divide
a page or it can just be a container for any type of content. Likewise, a
<span> tag can contain text, take the form of a button, hold a link to another
page in it, etc.


<div>
A <div> tag represents a division in HTML content. It serves as a nonsemantic section or container for any kind of content. A <div> is known as
a block-level element.
1) It always starts on a new line on the webpage
2) It automatically has upper and lower spacing (margin) added to it
3) It always takes up the full width available within its parent element,
stretching out as far left and right as it can
4) It always occupies vertical space equal to the height of its contents,
creating a “block”


<span>
A <span> tag can enclose text or just a part of an HTML document. It is a lot
like the <div> tag, except it’s an inline-level element.
Unlike a block-level element, an inline element:
1) Does not start on a new line
2) Only takes up as much width as necessary

The main difference between <div> and <span> is that a <div> tag will start
its own “container” or “box” and take up the whole width of the page. On
the other hand, <span> can occupy any part of a page, making it a little bit
more flexible.

<ol>, <ul>, and <dl>
An ordered list <ol> is a number-ordered list.
An unordered list <ul> appears as a series of bullet points.
A description list <dl> can be used with words and their respective
definitions.
<li>, <dt>, and <dd>
Ordered and unordered lists have list items which use the <li> tag.
A description list has two child tags, a description tag <dt> and a
description definition tag <dd>


<a>
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, linking one page to another.
The href attribute in particular defines the URL of the page a link goes to.

<input>
The appearance of an <input> tag can change depending on the value of its
type attribute. An <input> tag specifies a field where a user can enter data.
<label>
The <label> tag will define the label for our <input> form fields. The for
attribute connects the label to its respective form field, as long as that form
field element has the exact same value for its id attribute.
A <button> can take the form of text or even an image.
