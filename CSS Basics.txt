The Box Model
Recall that in HTML, each element is a part of the Document Object Model
(DOM) Tree which is a tree-like representation of the elements on our
webpage.
In addition, each element is also visually surrounded by a box, allowing us
to decorate its:
- Margin (top, right. bottom, left)
- Border
- Padding (top, right. bottom, left)
- Content
These four items (margin, border, padding, and content) make up the box
model.

Padding

For stylesheets, the rel attribute should always be set to "stylesheet" to indicate that the linked resource is a CSS stylesheet that should 
be applied to the current document for styling purposes.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
p {
    /* Your styles here */
}
.my-class {
    /* Your styles here */
}
#my-id {
    /* Your styles here */
}

Margin & Padding
You’ll notice that both the margin and padding CSS attributes have four
values, denoted in pixel (px). A pixel in CSS is defined as of 1 inch. In
respective order, these pixel values indicate the measurements of the top,
right, bottom, and left sides of the margin and padding of our first <div>
element.
You can easily remember this order with this mnemonic device: “Going
clockwise, Margin and Padding are TRouBLe!” (where T = top, R = right, B =
bottom, and L = left).
